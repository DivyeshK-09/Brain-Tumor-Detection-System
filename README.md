# Brain Tumor Detection System

    Detects and classifies if one has brain tumor on the basis of provided MRI scanned images, this uses logistic regression model and the Xception model which works on the principle of CNN (Convolutional Neural Netwroks).

    I used a dataset of total 7033 scanned MRI images to train the model, using the 'tensorflow' library to precess the images.

    To deploy the project, I used streamlit which, by running the app.py python script creates a local host, where you get a UI to use the prediction model on predefined and 'custom' images of MRI scans.
